Holman Jenkins, Jr.’s insightful column “Boeing and Automation Standoff” (Business World, Jan. 10) does not mention the essence of Boeing’s problems. Boeing’s head is located in the Washington, D.C., suburbs. Boeing’s body is in Washington state. Boeing’s heart is somewhere over Chicago. Reintegration is essential for future success.
