Alaska Airlines Chief Executive Ben Minicucci vented his frustration with Boeing after a door plug blew off an Alaska flight earlier this month, terrifying passengers and resulting in a weeks-long grounding.

“I'm angry. I'm more than frustrated and disappointed. I am angry,” he told NBC Nightly News in an interview scheduled to air this evening. “This happened to Alaska Airlines. It happened to our guests and happened to our people.”

Minicucci told NBC that Alaska has found loose bolts on many of the 737 MAX 9 jets it has inspected while the planes have been grounded. The Federal Aviation Administration is reviewing data from initial inspections of 40 MAX 9 jets, and hasn't yet given airlines the go-ahead to fully inspect the rest of their fleets.

Alaska, which flies only Boeing jets, has said it will increase its oversight of Boeing’s production line. “My demand on Boeing is what are they going to do to improve their quality programs in-house,” Minicucci told NBC.

Stan Deal, Boeing's commercial chief, said that the plane maker was sorry for the disruptions to airlines' operations. He said that Boeing has a comprehensive plan to safely return planes to service and improve its quality and delivery performance.

Boeing has launched an internal review and has said it supports the government investigations.

Boeing’s manufacturing and regulatory problems have created challenges for other airlines. A protracted halt in deliveries of Boeing’s Dreamliner jet led American Airlines to cut some flights in 2022 and 2023.
