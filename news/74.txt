Federal regulators have formally notified Boeing BA -0.71%decrease; red down pointing triangle that it is being investigated following an incident with its 737 MAX 9 plane.

The Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday that it had notified Boeing of the investigation, which will determine if the company failed to ensure products were safe and met approved designs.

The investigation follows an incident on Friday on an Alaska Airlines flight, in which a door plug blew out from the plane mid-flight.

The FAA ordered temporary grounding and inspections of the MAX 9 planes on Saturday following the incident.

Alaska has since canceled all of its MAX 9 flights through this coming Saturday as it inspects aircraft. United Airlines and Alaska both found some loose parts on inspected planes.
